The Alarm Clock Project is a web application developed using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. The primary objective of this project is to create a user-friendly digital alarm clock that allows users to set alarms and receive audible notifications when the alarm time is reached. The project demonstrates the integration of front-end technologies to create a functional and visually appealing alarm clock interface.

**Introduction**
An alarm clock is a common utility used to wake individuals up at specific times. This project aims to replicate the functionality of a traditional alarm clock using web technologies. The project implements a user interface where users can set alarms, view the current time, and be alerted when an alarm goes off.

**Technologies Used**

**HTML:** Hypertext Markup Language is used to structure the content and layout of the web application.
**CSS:** Cascading Style Sheets is employed to style and design the user interface, enhancing the visual appeal.
**JavaScript:** Vanilla JavaScript is used to implement the interactive features of the alarm clock, including setting alarms and triggering notifications.

**Features**
**Digital Clock Display:** The project displays the current time in a digital format, updating in real-time.
**Alarm Setting:** Users can set alarms by selecting the hour and minute using dropdown menus and clicking a "Set Alarm" button.
**Alarm Notification:** When the alarm time is reached, a sound notification is played to alert the user.
**Multiple Alarms:** Users can set multiple alarms, and each alarm functions independently.
**Alarm Removal:** Set alarms can be removed individually, allowing users to manage their alarms effectively.

**Conclusion**
The Alarm Clock Project showcases the integration of HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript to create a functional and visually appealing digital alarm clock. The project successfully demonstrates the ability to set multiple alarms, remove alarms, and receive notifications when alarm times are reached. This project can serve as a foundation for further enhancements, such as more advanced styling, user preferences, and additional features like snooze options.
